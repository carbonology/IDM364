# ESLint

- [https://eslint.org](https://eslint.org)

Projects created using Create React App have linting with ESLint already working and configured out of the box with sensible defaults. For most scenarios that means that you donâ€™t have anything else to do and everything will just work.

## Global Installation

Globally install ESLint on your system:

```bash
npm install -g eslint
```

## Check Installed Version Number

```bash
eslint -v
```

## Global Configuration File

You can choose to setup configuration files for how eslint will lint your files. ESLint will first look in your project folder for a configuration file. If it does not fine one, it will then look in your home directory (`~/.eslintrc` or `C:\Users\username\.eslintrc`).
